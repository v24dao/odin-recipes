        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Duck fat</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>Other seasoning (to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Chop your potatoes into evenly sized cubes. Make sure that they
                are not too small.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add your chopped potatoes into a pot of cold, salted water, and
                boil on a high heat. If you boil the water first, the outside of
                your potatoes will cook faster than the inside, resulting in an
                undesirable texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the water starts to boil, lower the heat slightly and leave
                to simmer for around 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                We want our potatoes to be fork tender. Check on them at the 6,
                8 and 10 minute mark just to be sure.
            </li>
            <li>Drain your potatoes into a metal colander.</li>
            <li>
                Place your potatoes into a container along with salt, pepper and
                a little bit of olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put a lid on your container, and shake your potatoes for 15-20
                seconds. This will create rough edges, resulting in more crispy
                potatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave your potatoes covered for 5 minutes, allowing the steam to
                continue cooking them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Air Fry your potatoes at 200 degrees celcius for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coat your potatoes in italian seasoning and a little bit of duck
                fat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Air Fry for a further 4-10 minutes, depending on your
                preference.
            </li>
